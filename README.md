## Overview
ESL-NN is a "Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification System" based on [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) which is free for download and free for non-commecial use.

## Features
* Single label classification (Binary classification)
* Multi-class classification
* Multi-label classification
* Hierarchical multi-label classification with tree and DAG structure.

## Supported Platforms
* MacOS
* Linux
