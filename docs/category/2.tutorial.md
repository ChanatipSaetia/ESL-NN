# Training Process
1. Store dataset and hierarchical structure(if the task is hierarchical classification) in the /data in the following format
~~~~
data/
    <your_dataset_name>/
        <your_train_file_name>.txt
        <your_test_file_name>.txt
        hierarchy.txt
~~~~
Example
~~~~
data/
    wipo_d/
        train.txt
        test.txt
        hierarchy.txt
~~~~
2. Config the classifier by edit `config.json`. The configuration setting is explained [here](/category/3.configuration)
3. Open a terminal and run
~~~~
./classifier/Predictor
~~~~
4. After the system is finished, the all result file will store in the `export/<your_dataset_name>` folder. In the folder will store this following file.
    * `result.txt` - store the evaluation result in term of f1 macro and micro
    * `prediction` - a folder which store the prediction of each instance in a dataset
    * `probability_prediction` - a folder which store the probability prediction of each instance in a dataset
    * `doc2vec` - a folder which store the document embedding of each instance in a dataset
    * `level_i.model` - the model of ith level classifier
    * `doc2vec.model` - the model of document embedding

# Evaluation Process
1. Store a dataset similar with training process
2. Config the classifier by edit `evaluater_config.json`. The configuration setting is explained [here](/category/3.configuration)
3. Open a terminal and run
~~~~
./classifier/Evaluater
~~~~
4. After the system is finished, the evaluation result file will store in the `export/<your_dataset_name>` folder. In the folder will store this following file.
    * `result_<your_file_name>.txt` - store the evaluation result in term of f1 macro and micro
    * `prediction/<your_file_name>.txt` - the prediction of each instance in a dataset
    * `probability_prediction/<your_file_name>.txt` - the probability prediction of each instance in a dataset
